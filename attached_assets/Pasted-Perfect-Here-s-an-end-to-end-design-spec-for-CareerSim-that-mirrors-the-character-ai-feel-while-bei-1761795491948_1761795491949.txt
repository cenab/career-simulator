Perfect. Here’s an end-to-end design spec for CareerSim that mirrors the character.ai feel while being decisively your own product. It’s written so you can hand it to a builder (or your Replit project) and they’ll know exactly what to create. No code—pure design + UX, all pages described.

6) Content model (schemas)

Scene (Preset)

id, slug, title, tagline
thumbnail, banner
creator { id, handle, org? }
meta { difficulty: "easy|med|hard", duration_min, mode: "solo|group",
       languages: [], rating, plays, saves }
skills: [ "Negotiation", "Stakeholder Mgmt", ... ]
world { setting, constraints[], tone }
roles: [ { name, archetype, temperament {0..100}, knowledge_scope, sample_openers[] } ]
flow { beats[], branches[] }
feedback { rubric: [ {dim, desc, weight} ], tips: [ {dim, text, trigger} ] }
safety { rating: "pro-safe|mature", blocked_terms[] }
distribution { visibility: "public|private|org", price, license }

Session

id, sceneId, userId, orgId?
start_at, end_at, duration
config { role, difficulty, time_limit, feedback_on, confidential }
transcript [ {speaker: "user|ai|event", text, ts} ]
scores { dim -> 1..5, overall }
summary { strengths[], opportunities[], key_moments[] }

Assignment (B2B)

id, sceneId, creatorId, due_at
recipients [userId|email]
status {assigned, in_progress, complete}
metrics { completion_rate, avg_score }

7) Key flows

A) First-time user
	1.	Landing → Try demo → minimal chat → Upsell sign up
	2.	Signup → /home → click a Scene → Start Simulation → Summary → Save to Library

B) Power user
	•	Full-screen search → filter by Skills “Negotiation” + Duration 10–20m → open scene → quick “Start”

C) Creator
	•	/create wizard → publish (private or public) → share → watch plays & reviews

D) Org admin
	•	Choose scenes → create assignment → recipients → monitor analytics → export

⸻

8) Micro-interactions (feel like character.ai)
	•	Card hover: lift + subtle gradient sweep; reveal quick actions
	•	Search focus: screen dims with 8–12px blur; trending list lights up
	•	Start: shared element transition (scene card thumbnail → chat header avatar)
	•	Typing: pulsing ellipsis bubble
	•	Rubric meters: spring to new values after each turn; confetti for high scores (respect reduced motion)

⸻

9) Copy guidelines
	•	Titles concise, action-led: “Crisis Manager: Vendor Breach”
	•	Meta labels short: 15m, Medium, Solo, Negotiation
	•	Coach tone: constructive, specific; avoid judgment (“Consider asking about X to clarify Y.”)
	•	Safety banner (org): “Professional mode active. Personal or sensitive topics are filtered.”

⸻

10) Monetization UX
	•	Free: daily chat cap, limited scenes, summaries watermarked
	•	Pro (CareerSim+): unlimited chats, advanced analytics, custom colors/wallpapers, voice, export PDF
	•	Teams: seats, org library, assignments, analytics, SSO
	•	Upsell surfaces: summary screen, voices/customize modals, subtle header badge

⸻

11) Telemetry (what to instrument)
	•	view_scene, start_sim, finish_sim, export_summary, save_scene
	•	Filters used in search (skills, difficulty, duration)
	•	Builder events: create_scene, publish_scene, edit_scene
	•	Workspace: create_assignment, complete_assignment, view_analytics
	•	Conversion: upgrade_click, checkout_start, checkout_success

⸻

12) Compliance, privacy, safety
	•	Toggleable Confidential Mode (do not store transcripts; only store scores aggregate)
	•	Data retention policy visible in Settings
	•	Pro-safe catalog for orgs; report button on every scene; moderation queue
	•	Accessibility statement; keyboard coverage documented

⸻

13) Sizing & acceptance per major screen (quick checklist)

Discover
	•	5 sections minimum: For You, Scenes, Featured, Popular, New
	•	Each carousel supports mouse drag, wheel, arrows, touch

Scene detail
	•	Sticky right sheet works at all breakpoints
	•	“Start simulation” always visible above the fold

Chat
	•	Streaming replies; side panel toggle persists
	•	Summary contains at least 3 “evidence quotes” tied to rubric dims

Create wizard
	•	Autosave every 3 seconds after change
	•	Can publish with minimum: title, one role, 3 rubric dims, thumbnail

Workspace
	•	Assignment creation < 4 steps
	•	Analytics exports CSV & PDF

⸻

14) Differentiators vs character.ai (to avoid a clone)
	•	Right Objectives & Rubric panel during chat
	•	Summary with evidence quotes & actionable tips
	•	B2B workspace (assignments, analytics) as first-class
	•	Brand accents, spacing rhythm, avatar treatment slightly different
	•	Professional catalog & safety modes

⸻

If you want, I can turn this into:
	•	a component inventory (names + props) your FE can mirror,
	•	a style-token JSON your team can drop into a design system, and
	•	a QA checklist per route before launch.

Want me to draft those three add-ons next?
