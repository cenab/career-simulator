OK THIS IS THE UI I CREATED FROM REPLIT. I WANT TO KEEP THIS EXACT UI AND STYLE. I WANT NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER IN THE UI. I WANT TO CREATE A REST API BACKEND FOR THIS. END TO END. BUT I WANT YOU TO CREATE ALL THE API POINTS THAT WILL BE NEEDED AND UNDERSTAND THIS FROM THE UI. THIS IS THE APP WE ARE GONNA DO.

CareerSim: Role-Playing Presets for Interview & Workplace Scenarios

Concept:
A gamified training platform offering “career world presets” — e.g., “Startup Chaos Mode,” “Corporate Politics 101,” “Crisis Manager,” etc.
Why it could work:
HR, universities, and leadership programs are increasingly gamifying soft-skill training.
Bonus: AI feedback on decision-making and communication tone.
Monetization: B2B SaaS for HR departments.

I WANT YOU TO GENERATE THE ENDPOINT SPECIFICATION OR THE BEST WAY TO IMPLEMENT THIS TO THE BACKEND. SO THAT I CAN PASS IT TO THE AGENT AND BUILD THE BACKEND FOR IT.
